	* ximian_unmarshaller/unmarshaller.c (node_new): Use
	g_value_take_boxed, as we don't want it to make copy of value.
	(node_push): g_value_array_append() makes copy of data, so free
	it after insertion.
	(g_value_to_PyObject): PyDict_SetItem () increfs key and value,
	decref them after insertion.
	(unmarshaller_dealloc): Free the root node after unsetting.
	Make it build cleanly.

	* Makefile.am: don't hardcode "python" use $(PYTHON)

2003-05-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add a clean target

	* setup.py: Link against gobject and expat

	* unmarshaller.c: Use our newer, faster unmarshaller from red-carpet.

2002-12-12  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* unmarshaller.c (unmarshaller_close): If an exception was raised
	during our call to PyEval_CallObject, return NULL to pass it up
	the stack.  This makes the right thing happen w/ python 2.x.

2002-12-03  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* unmarshaller.c: Added a fault_cb to the PyUnmarshaller struct.
	(unmarshaller_close): If the fault flag is set, execute our fault
	callback.
	(unmarshaller_new): Take a fault callback as an argument.

2002-11-27  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Added setup.py and unmarshaller.c to EXTRA_DIST.
	We now pass 'make distcheck'.

2002-11-21  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* Added initial versions of Makefile.am, unmarshaller.c, setup.py.
