	* Makefile.am: don't hardcode "python" use $(PYTHON)

2003-05-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add a clean target

	* setup.py: Link against gobject and expat

	* unmarshaller.c: Use our newer, faster unmarshaller from red-carpet.

2002-12-12  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* unmarshaller.c (unmarshaller_close): If an exception was raised
	during our call to PyEval_CallObject, return NULL to pass it up
	the stack.  This makes the right thing happen w/ python 2.x.

2002-12-03  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* unmarshaller.c: Added a fault_cb to the PyUnmarshaller struct.
	(unmarshaller_close): If the fault flag is set, execute our fault
	callback.
	(unmarshaller_new): Take a fault callback as an argument.

	We now pass 'make distcheck'.
