.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
rc is the command\-line complement to the Ximian Red Carpet software management tool.  It works with the rcd daemon to install, update, and remove software according to the commands you give it. The software which it installs can be from local files or from Ximian servers and mirrors, and the system where software is being managed can be a remote system (see the \-\-host option and the rcd(8) man page) rather than the local system running rc.
.LP 
Red Carpet services sort software by category into channels, groups of similar software. For example, one channel might contain software from the operating system vendor, and another the Ximian Desktop, and another one the Ximian Connector or some software from a third\-party software vendor. You can subscribe to individual channels to control the display of available packages and prevent the accidental installation of unwanted software. Operations are normally performed only on software from within channels to which you are subscribed, although you may alter this with the \fI\-\-allow\-unsubscribed\fR flag.
.LP 
Red Carpet services, including rc, use your operating system's native package management system (except on Solaris), so you can use most other package management tools alongside them.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.LP 
rc provides a number of commands (shown as <\fIcommand\fR> in the SYNTAX section), each of which has a number of options in addition to the global options which affect all transactions. The most commonly used is \fIrc update\-all\fR which downloads and installs updates in channels to which you are subscribed. If you only want to update software, that is the only command you need.

.LP 
\fBPackage management commands:\fR
.TP 
info \fI<packagename>\fR 
Show detailed information about a package. Multiple packages may be listed, separated by spaces.  

.TP 
install \fI<packagename>\fR\fR
Install the specified package or packages. Multiple packages may be listed, separated by spaces. If \fIpackagename\fR designates a package which you already have installed, but for which a newer version is available, the new version will be downloaded and installed.

.TP 
packages \fI<"channelname">\fR\fR
List the packages in a channel. If no channel is specified, all packages will be listed. If an ambiguous channel name is specified, specific channels will be suggested. You may use the full channel name or an alias. Multiple channel names may be used, separated by spaces.
 
.TP  
remove (rm, erase) \fI<packagename>\fR
Remove packages. Both \fIrm\fR and \fIerase\fR are equivalents.

.TP 
search \fI<querystring>\fR
Search for the query string in the list of packages.

.TP 
summary (sum)
Display a summary of available updates.

.TP 
list\-updates (lu) [channelname] [channelname]
List updates in subscribed channels. Adding channels as arguments will limit the list to those channels you specify.  If you are not subscribed to a channel, it will never have updates available, even if you name it here; you must subscribe to list updates.

.TP 
update (up) [channelname] [channelname]
Download and install updates.  With no arguments, this will get all updates for subscribed channels. To choose specific channels, list them as arguments, separated by spaces.  For single packages, use rc install. If you are not subscribed to a channel, it will never have updates available; you must subscribe to install updates. If you want to install or update software from a channel to which you are not subscribed, use rc install with the \-u option.

.TP 
verify
Verify system dependencies. If the system dependencies are not satisfied, rc will suggest the removal or installation of packages necessary to resolve the conflicts.

.LP 
\fBChannel commands:\fR
.TP 
channels (ch) 
List available channels

.TP 
subscribe (sub)\fI<channelname>\fR
Subscribe to a channel. You may use the full channel name or the alias.

.TP 
unsubscribe (unsub) \fI<channelname>\fR
Unsubscribe from a channel.  You may use the full channel name or its alias.

.LP 
\fBDependency analysis commands:\fR 
.TP 
info\-conflicts (ic) \fI<packagename>\fR
List all packages that conflict with \fIpackagename.\fR

.TP 
info\-provides (ip)  \fI<packagename>\fR
Display the functionality or libraries that a package provides. If you wish to specify a particular channel from which to get the package, use the syntax [channel alias + ':']<package name> as is described in the EXAMPLES section.

.TP 
info\-requirements (ir)  \fI<packagename>\fR
List the software that must be present before the package can be installed.  

.TP 
solvedeps (solve) \fI<string>\fR 
Install or remove software to meet package, application, or library, and can include version numbers or ranges. The ! operator is used to indicate removal.  For example, the command rc solvedeps "!rpm\-python" "rpm404\-python" will remove the rpm\-python package, and replace it with the rpm404\-python package.

.TP 
what\-conflicts (wc) \fI<packagename>\fR
List packages that conflict with the item you specify.

.TP 
what\-provides (wp) \fI<querystring>\fR
List packages that provide the library, program, or package that you specify.

.TP 
what\-requires (wr)  \fI<querystring>\fR       
List packages that require the library, program, or package you specify.

.LP 
\fBPreference management commands:\fR 
.TP

.TP 
shutdown
Halt the server's rcd process.

.LP 
\fBUser management commands:\fR 
.TP 
user\-add
Create an account with the Red Carpet Daemon so that someone can manage software on your system without logging into it directly. This command can also be used to grant administration access to non\-root local users.

.TP 
user\-delete  \fI<username>\fR
Delete a specific user.

.TP 
user\-list
List the users that may update your system software.

.LP 
\fBOther commands:\fR 
.TP 
help \fI<command>\fR
Get detailed help on a command. If no command is specified, displays a list of all of the available commands.

.TP

.SH "FILES"
.TP 
 \fI.rcrc\fR

  The \fI.rcrc\fR resource file is optional. If it exists, its contents are treated as additional arguments to the rc command being executed.  This is similar to the behavior of the RC_ARGS environment variable.  Note also that the .rcrc file used is in the home directory of the user running rc, and if you run rc through sudo instead of directly as root, you will not use the root user's .rcrc file.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP 
\fBRC_ARGS\fP
This environment variable is prepended to any
command line options that are passed to rc and acts as an extra set of arguments.  The variable is ignored if the \fI\-\-ignore\-env\fR flag is set. Do not attempt to set the \fI\-\-ignore\-env\fR flag in the RC_ARGS variable; this is absurd.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP 
In most cases, non\-root users will be able to query the system but not alter it. However, system administrators may use the user\-add (ua) command to create rcd accounts for non\-root users if they wish.
 
Note that rc will use the .rcrc file in the home directory of the user running the program, and that putting the file just in root's home directory will not ensure that it is used every time.

.LP 
Here are some standard ways in which the program might be used:
.TP 
\fBrc update \-y\fR
Download and install all updates to currently installed package in currently subscribed channels, removing any software that conflicts with those updates, and without asking for confirmation. This is convenient option but should be used only with servers which you trust absolutely.

.TP 
\fBrc \-Vu \-\-host=\fI<hostname>\fB install \fI<packagename>\fR
This will operate in verbose mode and contact the rcd daemon on the specified host to install the specified package, regardless of whether it is in a channel to which the user is subscribed.

.TP 
\fBrc solvedeps \fI"library.so.1" "application < 1.2"\fR
Installs the package that provides \fIlibrary.so.1\fR and a version of \fIapplication\fR lower than 1.2.

.TP 
\fBrc info\-provides mychannel:mypackage</fR>
Displays the functionality provided by the "mypackage" software from "mychannel."
