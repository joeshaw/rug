.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
rc is the command\-line complement to the Ximian Red Carpet software management tool.  It works with the rcd daemon to install, update, and remove software according to the commands you give it. The software which it installs can be from local files or from Ximian servers and mirrors, and the system where software is being managed can be a remote system (see the \-\-host option and the rcd(8) man page) rather than the local system running rc.
.LP 
Red Carpet services sort software by category into channels, groups of similar software. For example, one channel might contain software from the operating system vendor, and another the Ximian Desktop, and another one the Ximian Connector or some software from a third\-party software vendor. You can subscribe to individual channels to control the display of available packages and prevent the accidental installation of unwanted software. Operations are normally performed only on software from within channels to which you are subscribed, although you may alter this with the \fI\-\-allow\-unsubscribed\fR flag.
.LP 
Red Carpet services, including rc, use your operating system's native package management system (except on Solaris, where they use RPM), so you can use most other package management tools alongside them.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.LP 
rc provides a number of commands (shown as <\fIcommand\fR> in the SYNTAX section), each of which has a number of options in addition to the global options which affect all transactions. The most commonly used is \fIrc update\-all\fR which downloads and installs updates in channels to which you are subscribed. If you only want to update software, that is the only command you need.

.LP 
\fBPackage management commands:\fR
.LP 
Note that you may substitute standard shell wildcards in package names, although not in channel names.
.TP 
info \fI<packagename>\fR 
Show detailed information about a package. Multiple packages may be listed, separated by spaces.

.TP 
install \fI<packagename>\fR
Install the specified package or packages. Multiple packages may be listed, separated by spaces. If \fIpackagename\fR designates a package which you already have installed, but for which a newer version is available, the new version will be downloaded and installed.

.TP 
lock\-add (la) \fI<options>\fR <packagename>  \fI[<relation> <version>]\fR
Add a package lock rule. This prevents changes to the installation state of the package which are not specifically requested.  The package name can be specified individually, with wildcard patterns, or even with version number relations. For example, the command \fIrc lock\-add gnome*<2.0\fR would keep all GNOME packages below 2.0.

.TP 
lock\-delete (ld) \fI<options>\fR <lock\-number>
Delete the lock you specify by its number. You can find the numbers for each lock with the lock\-list (ll) command.

.TP 
lock\-list (ll) \fI<options>\fR [<relation> <version>]
List the locks that have been put in place. Locks are sorted by ID number.

.TP 
packages \fI<"channelname">\fR\fR
List all packages in a channel. If no channel is specified, all installed packages will be listed. If an ambiguous channel name is specified, specific channels will be suggested. You may use the full channel name or an alias. Multiple channel names may be used, separated by spaces.
<LI>
The output for this command is in three columns. The first column indicates the status, the second the name of the package, and the third the version of the package. The package status column will be empty if the package is not installed, and will show "i" if the package is installed, or "v" if the package is installed but is a different version from the one displayed in the list. If a package is locked (see the entries for the rc commands lock\-add, lock\-delete, and lock\-list), the status column will also display an L.
 
.TP  
remove (rm, erase) \fI<packagename>\fR
Remove packages. Both \fIrm\fR and \fIerase\fR are equivalents.

.TP 
rollback (ro) \fI[options] <packagename>\fR
Downgrade to the previous version of a package. To use this command you must use "rc set" to set the "repackage" variable in the [System] section of rcd.conf to "true" (see rcd.conf(5) for more information). Caveats: this feature only works on systems using RPM version 4.0.4 or greater,  will cause upgrades and removals to be very slow, and uses significant amounts of disk space.

.TP 
search \fI<querystring>\fR
Search for the query string in the list of packages.

.TP 
summary (sum)
Display a summary of available updates.

.TP 
list\-updates (lu) [channelname] [channelname]
List updates in subscribed channels. Adding channels as arguments will limit the list to those channels you specify.  If you are not subscribed to a channel, it will never have updates available, even if you name it here; you must subscribe to list updates.

.TP 
update (up) [channelname] [channelname]
Download and install updates.  With no arguments, this will get all updates for subscribed channels. To choose specific channels, list them as arguments, separated by spaces.  For single packages, use rc install. If you are not subscribed to a channel, it will never have updates available; you must subscribe to install updates. If you want to install or update software from a channel to which you are not subscribed, use rc install with the \-u option.

.TP 
verify
Verify system dependencies. If the system dependencies are not satisfied, rc will suggest the removal or installation of packages necessary to resolve the conflicts.

.LP 
\fBChannel commands:\fR
.TP 
channels (ch) 
List available channels. Output is in three columns: The first indicating whether you are subscribed to the channel, the second showing the short alias for the channel, and the third showing the full channel name.

.TP 
subscribe (sub)\fI<channelname>\fR
Subscribe to a channel. You may use the full channel name or the alias.

.TP 
unsubscribe (unsub) \fI<channelname>\fR
Unsubscribe from a channel.  You may use the full channel name or its alias.

.LP 
\fBDependency analysis commands:\fR 

.TP 
dangling\-requires
This command takes no arguments or options, and designed more for administrators to check the coherence of shipped software. It walks across all packages in all channels on the server, to see if there are any dependencies that are not provided by something else on the server. 

.TP 
info\-conflicts (ic) \fI<packagename>\fR
List all packages that conflict with \fIpackagename.\fR

.TP 
info\-provides (ip)  \fI<packagename>\fR
Display the functionality or libraries that a package provides. If you wish to specify a particular channel from which to get the package, use the syntax [channel alias + ':']<package name> as is described in the EXAMPLES section.

.TP 
info\-requirements (ir)  \fI<packagename>\fR
List the software that must be present before the package can be installed.  

.TP 
solvedeps (solve) \fI<string>\fR 
Install or remove software to meet package, application, or library, and can include version numbers or ranges. The ! operator is used to indicate removal.  For example, the command rc solvedeps "!rpm\-python" "rpm404\-python" will remove the rpm\-python package, and replace it with the rpm404\-python package.

.TP 
what\-conflicts (wc) \fI<packagename>\fR
List packages that conflict with the item you specify.

.TP 
what\-provides (wp) \fI<querystring>\fR
List packages that provide the library, program, or package that you specify.

.TP 
what\-requires (wr)  \fI<querystring>\fR       
List packages that require the library, program, or package you specify.

.LP 
\fBPreference management commands:\fR 
.TP 
get\-prefs (get, prefs)\fR   
List the system preferences that may be set.

.TP 
set\-prefs (set) \fI<key> <value>\fR         
Set the preference variable \fIkey\fR to the value \fI<value>\fR. Options are normally stored in the rcd.conf file (see rcd.conf(5) for more information), and can be changed by editing that file directly. However, additional Red Carpet modules can create additional settings which are not necessarily kept in rcd.conf but which are still set with the rc set.  The base set of options is:
.IP 
\fBhost:\fR The URL of the Red Carpet Server you will be using.
.IP                                             
\fBenable\-premium:\fR If the value is true, the server is an Enterprise, CorporateConnect, or Express server.
.IP      
\fBproxy\-url:\fR URL for the proxy server, if any.
.IP 
\fBproxy\-username:\fR Username for the proxy, if any.
.IP

.IP 
\fBhttp\-1.0:\fR Use the HTTP/1.0 protocol for communications with the server. Defaults to False.
.IP 
\fBcache\-enabled:\fR If True, cache downloaded packages and metadata. Defaults is True.
.IP 
\fBcache\-directory:\fR The directory where cached data are stored. Default is /var/cache/redcarpet.
.IP 
\fBcache\-cleanup\-enabled:\fR Delete old packages from the cache. Default is True. 
.IP 
\fBcache\-max\-age\-in\-days:\fR The number of days to leave packages in the cache (if cache\-cleanup\-enabled is true). Default is 30.
.IP 
\fBcache\-max\-size\-in\-mb:\fR Maximum size of the cache before cleanup (if cleanup is enabled). Default is 300.
.IP 
\fBrequire\-signatures:\fR Require packages be signed before installing.         
.IP 
\fBheartbeat\-interval:\fR The interval in seconds between automatic refreshes of server data (in seconds). The default is 21600.
.IP 
\fBmax\-downloads:\fR Maximum number of concurrent package downloads. Default value is 5.
.IP 
\fBdebug\-level:\fR Sets the amount of debugging output to stderr. Values may be from 0 (none) to 6 (lots). The default is 4.
.IP 
\fBsyslog\-level:\fR Sets the amount of logging output saved in syslog. Values may be from 0 (none) to 6 (lots). The default is 4.

.LP 
\fBSystem commands:\fR
.br 
.TP 
activate (act)<activation code> <email address>
Activates the machine for a premium server, allowing it access to private channels hosted there.

.TP 
dump
Get an XML dump of system information. Usually used for debugging purposes; the output of this command is best directed to a file and compressed.

.TP 
mount <path>

.TP 
mirrors
Choose a mirror from a list of available mirrors.

.TP 
ping \fI<servername>\fR 
Ping the rcd process on the server. If no server is specified, the current server will be pinged.

.TP 
refresh
Refresh channel data for all channels.

.TP 
recurring
Display information about recurring events, including both AutoPull and heartbeat (automatic channel refresh).  The command provides the label for the transaction, the total number of times it has occurred, and the date and time of the next and previous transactions. 

.TP 
shutdown
Halt the server's rcd process.
.TP 
unmount <channel>
Unmount a directory that has been mounted as a channel.

.LP 
\fBUser management commands:\fR 
.TP 
user\-add [username] [privileges]
Create an account with the Red Carpet Daemon so that someone can manage software on your system without logging into it directly. This command can also be used to grant administration access to non\-root local users. You may provide the username and the names of privileges to be granted as arguments. If you do not, you will be prompted for them. After adding the user, it starts the user\-update tool to set privileges. To quit, press \fBEnter\fR on a blank line. See the EXAMPLES section for an example of how to use this command.

.TP 
user\-delete  \fI<username>\fR
Delete a specific user.

.TP 
user\-edit\fI<username>\fR
Display a list of the user's privileges. This command is interactive: it will first list the privileges, then offer you a prompt. Enter the plus (+) or minus (\-) symbol and then the name of the privilege, then press \fBEnter\fR. For example, to permit the user to install software, you would type \fB+install\fR.  To save and quit, press \fBEnter\fR on a blank line. 

.TP 
user\-list
List the users known to the daemon.


.LP 
\fBOther commands:\fR

.SH "FILES"
.TP 
 \fI.rcrc\fR

  The \fI.rcrc\fR resource file is optional. If it exists, its contents are treated as additional arguments to the rc command being executed.  This is similar to the behavior of the RC_ARGS environment variable.  Note also that the .rcrc file used is in the home directory of the user running rc, and if you run rc through sudo instead of directly as root, you will not use the root user's .rcrc file.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP 
\fBRC_ARGS\fP
This environment variable is prepended to any
command line options that are passed to rc and acts as an extra set of arguments.  The variable is ignored if the \fI\-\-ignore\-env\fR flag is set. Do not attempt to set the \fI\-\-ignore\-env\fR flag in the RC_ARGS variable; this is absurd.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP 
In most cases, non\-root users will be able to query the system but not alter it. However, system administrators may use the user\-add (ua) command to create rcd accounts for non\-root users if they wish.
 
Note that rc will use the .rcrc file in the home directory of the user running the program, and that putting the file just in root's home directory will not ensure that it is used every time.

.LP 
Here are some standard ways in which the program might be used:
.TP 
\fBrc update \-y\fR
Download and install all updates to currently installed package in currently subscribed channels, removing any software that conflicts with those updates, and without asking for confirmation. This is convenient option but should be used only with servers which you trust absolutely.

.TP 
\fBrc \-Vu \-\-host=\fI<hostname>\fB install \fI<packagename>\fR
This will operate in verbose mode and contact the rcd daemon on the specified host to install the specified package, regardless of whether it is in a channel to which the user is subscribed.

.TP 
\fBrc solvedeps \fI"library.so.1" "application < 1.2"\fR
Installs the package that provides \fIlibrary.so.1\fR and a version of \fIapplication\fR lower than 1.2.

.TP 
\fBrc info\-provides mychannel:mypackage</fR>
Displays the functionality provided by the "mypackage" software from "mychannel."

.TP 
\fBrc install rc*\fR
Installs all packages that are in subscribed channels whose names begin with "rc".

.TP 
\fBrc ua donald install\fR
Adds a user named "donna" with the install privilege. After entering this command, you will be prompted to create and confirm a password for donna, and then to confirm or change the privileges granted to her.
