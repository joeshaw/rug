	* rcformat.py (display_version): Added.  Outputs a correctly
	formatted version.

	* rcpackagecmds.py: Use rcformat.display_version() throughout
	(find_package): Added.  Does a query based on a package name and
	optional channel.
	(PackageInstallCmd): Added.  Incomplete and kind of broken.

2002-06-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageListCmd): If no channels are specified,
	list the system packages.  Only show the "channel" field if there
	is more than one channel specified.

	* rcchannelcmds.py: Change a print to an rctalk.message

	* rccommand.py: Change the --dry-run shortcut from -n to -N and
	verbose's -v to -V so they don't conflict with other options.

	* rcpackagecmds.py: Use rctalk, add a first-cut PackageSearchCmd.

2002-06-10  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcchannelcmds.py: Added smarter name-based channel matching,
	replace prints with rctalk functions.

	* rc: Implement the --debug, --quiet, --verbose options.  Replace
	a bunch of prints with calls to rctalk.message, rctalk.warning,
	etc.

	* rccommand.py (default_opt_table): Added --quiet option.

	* rcformat.py (linebreak): Added.

	* rctalk.py: Added.  An interface for printing messages, which we
	should use instead of littering the code with prints.

2002-06-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (install_indicator): Get the system packages
	from the daemon so we can show if each package is installed on the
	system.

2002-06-07  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py: Added.  Supports listing of packages in a channel.
	Doesn't do installed packages yet.

2002-06-07  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rc: Handle cases like "rc -U channels refresh 20001" in which
	"channels" could get picked up as the action instead of "refresh".

	* rcchannelcmds.py: Pulled the default_opt_table out of the
	RCCommand class so we could walk it, for the above.

	* All files: Change the license to explicitly require version 2 of
	the GPL.

	* rcchannelcmds.py (RefreshChannelCmd): Added, refreshes all of
	the channels on the system or a specified channel.

2002-06-07  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rc: Print usage info if --help or -? is passed on the command
	line.  Small option-handling clean-ups.  Added license.

	* rcformat.py (opt_table): Added.  Generates a formated description
	of a list of command options.  Added license.

	* rccommand.py: Changed command registration slightly.  Hacked
	construct to accept unambiguous partial matches (i.e. "sub"
	for "subscribe").  Added usage method to RCCommand.  Moved
	default options into an RCCommand method.  Added license.

	* rcchannelcmds.py: Added support for more options, improved
	error handling.  Added license.
