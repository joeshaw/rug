	from the daemon and outputs a human-readable string.

	* rcchannelcmds.py (check_subscription_by_id): Added.

	set, always specify the	channel ID (for ease in scripting)
	(PackageSearchCmd.local_opt_table): Drop the "search-updates"
	switch from the	list.
	(PackageSearchCmd.execute): Allow a channel (or "all") to be
	specified with the -c option.  If not presented, search system
	packages.  Use the append_to_table() and sort_and_format_table()
	functions.

	* rcchannelcmds.py: Change a print to an rctalk.message

	* rcformat.py (linebreak): Added.

	* rctalk.py: Added.  An interface for printing messages, which we
	should use instead of littering the code with prints.

2002-06-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (install_indicator): Get the system packages
	from the daemon so we can show if each package is installed on the
	system.

2002-06-07  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py: Added.  Supports listing of packages in a channel.
	Doesn't do installed packages yet.

	"channels" could get picked up as the action instead of "refresh".
