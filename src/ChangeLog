2003-05-29  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rctransactcmds.py (PackageRollbackCmd): Add a -d/--download-only
	flag since we download packages to rollback now.  Make it accept a
	variety of date formats, and to correctly output text when there's
	nothing to rollback, and call the rollback RPC method itself and
	pass its pending IDs off to the poll_transaction() function.
	(date_converter): Write a function for parsing all sorts
	of time and date formats and handle CVS-like things like "2 weeks
	ago", "yesterday", "last month" and the like.

2003-05-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rctransactcmds.py: Fix cut-and-paste error in which we'd pass
	along install dependencies as remove dependencies too.

2003-05-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* ximian_xmlrpclib.py: Sync this up with the version from
	red-carpet so we can take advantage of our new fast unmarshaller.

2003-05-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcprefscmds.py (PrefsMirrorsCmd): Gracefully handle when there
	are no available mirrors.

2003-05-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rug.in: Fix another rc -> rug directory reference.

2003-05-20  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* rug.in: s/rc_dir/rug_dir/g

2003-05-19  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>
	
	* Rename to "rug".

	* Makefile.am: replace "rc" with "rug" for binaries and paths.

	* rc.in: Removed, replaced by rug.in.

	* rccommand.py: Replace the few instances where we call ourselves
	"rc" with "rug".
	(get_user_default_args): Check both .rugrc and .rcrc and both
	RUG_ARGS and RC_ARGS.  Prefer the new one if set.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageDanglingRequiresCmd): Add "dr" alias.

2003-05-19  Frank Belew  <frb@ximian.com>

	* rcusercmds.py (get_privileges): silly frb, python doesn't have ++

2003-05-18  Frank Belew  <frb@ximian.com>

	* rcusercmds.py (get_privileges): silly joe, python doesn't have +=

2003-05-16  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcusercmds.py (get_privileges): Handle spaces between "+"/"-"
	and the privilege name.  Fixes #43142.

2003-05-14  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcformat.py (package_to_row): If the package is actually a
	package set, append an "S" to the status column

2003-05-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py: This file was getting too long, so I split it
	into 3 files.  This now contains just the non-transaction related
	packaging commands.

	* rcpackageutils.py: Added.  A lot of package-related utility
	functions, like the find_package family and get_updates().

	* rctransactcmds.py: Added.  All the transaction-related commands
	like install, remove, update, solvedeps, verify and rollback are
	here.

	* rcmain.py: Import rctransactcmds.py.

2003-05-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageFileListCmd): Added a "file-list"
	command which lists the files within an installed package or
	package file.

2003-04-18  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageInfoRequirementsCmd): Added an
	'info-children' (or 'ichild') command, which for now is just a
	cut&paste of 'ir' with a few trivial changes.  This needs to fixed
	up later, since the data displayed, column headers, etc.  are not
	quite what they should be.

2003-04-17  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* Made a number of small changes to deal with the fact that
	channel IDs are now strings, not integers.  This breaks
	compatibility with old daemons.

2003-04-16  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (TransactCmd.check_licenses): Added.  Spew out
	the text of licenses that we require users to agree to.

	* rcsystemcmds.py (ShutdownCmd): Add a -n/--no-wait option causes
	rc not to wait for the daemon to shut down.
	(RestartCmd): Added.  Restarts the daemon.  Also has a
	-n/--no-wait option.

2003-04-14  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageInfoRequirementsCmd.execute): Print a
	message if the package has no requirements.  Fixes bug #41019.

2003-04-02  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (TransactCmd): Fix the text to suggest using
	the -r option instead of -d (it was changed long ago).

2003-04-02  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcmountcmds.py (UnmountCmd.aliases): Make 'umount' an alias for
	'unmount'.

2003-03-31  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcprefscmds.py (PrefsListCmd): Added.  Implements the "mirrors"
	command, allowing the list of mirrors to be viewed and a mirror to
	be selected.

2003-03-24  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rclockcmds.py (LockAddCmd.execute): In Python, there is a
	big difference between ',' and '%'.  Fixes #40215.

2003-03-20  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (TransactCmd.resolve_deps): Call
	extract_package when computing the download size.  This fixes a
	bug which was causing us to under-estimating the download size
	in many cases.

2003-03-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcprefscmds.py (PrefsSetCmd.execute): Accept yes/no and on/off
	for boolean settings.

2003-03-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcfault.py: Add not_supported

	* rcpackagecmds.py (TransactCmd, PackageRollbackCmd): If the
	server throws a not_supported fault, print out an error to the
	user.

2003-03-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcfault.py: Add cant_activate

	* rcsystemcmds.py (ActivateCmd.execute): Handle the cant_activate
	fault and print out the error to the user.

2003-03-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcsystemcmds.py (ActivateCmd): Add a -a/--alias option to the
	activate command.  If -a is set, call activate_with_alias() on the
	daemon, else regular activate().  Deal with trying to use aliases
	with old daemons that don't support it.

2003-02-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rctalk.py (prompt): Added.  Prints out the prompt, flushes
	stdout, and calls raw_input().  Should fix problems where prompts
	weren't being redirected to a file and people were wondering why
	rc hung in scripts.

	* rclockcmds.py (LockDeleteCmd): Use rctalk.prompt() instead of
	raw_input().

	* rcpackagecmds.py (TransactCmd): Ditto.

2003-01-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py (main): Slightly edit the text when we get a 401

2003-01-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcusercmds.py (UserEditCmd.execute): Don't allow the user to
	mess with privileges if they're not a superuser (we still show it
	if the daemon doesn't have the has_privilege call for backward
	compatibility)

2003-01-25  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageDanglingRequiresCmd): Added
	"dangling-requires" command.

	* rcmain.py (rc_copyright): Updated copyright string.

2003-01-24  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcmountcmds.py (MountCmd.execute): By popular demand: If no path
	is passed in to the mount command, list the currently-mounted
	channels.  Basically, 'rc mount' is now equivalent to 'rc ch -m'.

	* rcchannelcmds.py (ListChannelsCmd.execute): By popular demand:
	Added a --mounted argument, to only list mounted channels.

2003-01-20  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcchannelcmds.py (ListChannelsCmd.execute): Added --show-ids
	option.  Users should never need this information, but we
	need it all of the time.

2003-01-16  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py (main): Handle ProtocolErrors from ximian_xmlrpclib
	that have an error code of -1, which means that the client
	couldn't communicate with the server.  Most likely to come up when
	the user uses "-h http://host" instead of https.

2003-01-10  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (TransactCmd.resolve_deps): Fixed a typo --
	missing whitespace between 'least' and 'a'.
	(PackageInstallCmd.local_opt_table): Added 'entire-channel'
	option to opt table.
	(PackageInstallCmd.execute): Added implementation of
	entire-channel option for the install command.

2002-12-19  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcchannelutils.py (get_channels_by_name): If we find multiple
	matches, make a pass over the list of matches and look for exact
	matches.  If we find an exact match, drop the other matches.
	This fixes bug #35904.

2002-12-16  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py (main): sys.exit(1) on a couple of previously
	unhandled error conditions.

2002-12-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rclogcmds.py (log_entries_to_table): For terse output, include
	the package name.  Fixes #35452.

2002-12-09  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (TransactCmd.resolve_deps): When listing the
	packages in the transaction, show the size of the download.  This
	fixes bug #35262.

2002-12-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcmountmds.py (MountCmd.execute): Make the alias lower case.

2002-12-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcsystemcmds.py (ActivateCmd): Mention that the activation code
	or email address are invalid.

	* rcprefscmds.py (PrefsListCmd): Sort the prefs alphabetically by
	name.

2002-12-05  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rclockcmds.py (LockDeleteCmd): Add arguments

2002-12-04  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (find_package_on_system_exactly): Removed.
	(PackageRollbackCmd): If the current version on the system and the
	rollbackable version are the same, don't show it.

2002-12-03  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (find_latest_package): If the search returns no
	matches, tell the user that we couldn't find it and exit out.

2002-12-03  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackagesCmd.execute): Make "rc packages -u"
	show only uninstalled packages.

2002-12-03  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* ximian_xmlrpclib.py (getparser): When we construct a fast
	unmarshaller, pass in a fault-handling callback.

2002-11-21  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rc.in: Defined rc_lib_dir as a path for finding binary
	extensions.

2002-11-19  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageInfoCmd.execute): If no packages are
	specified, show the command usage.

2002-11-15  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackagesCmd.execute): Correctly handle
	multiple channels.

2002-11-14  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (TransactCmd.resolve_deps): Tell the user how
	many packages will be installed and how many will be removed.

2002-11-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcwhatcmds.py (WhateverCmd.execute): If we don't have any
	arguments, show the usage and abort.

2002-11-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py (main): Allow "http://" or "https://" to be passed in
	as part of the host.

	* ximian_xmlrpclib.py (Transport.make_connection,
	SafeTransport.make_connection): Check for a ValueError back from
	the HTTP or HTTPS constructors.  Python 2.2's httplib doesn't
	throw a socket exception like 1.5's did when it has an invalid
	port, and it tries to do an int() on an invalid string literal.
	Bah.

2002-11-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcchannelutils.py (refresh_channels): Use pending.get() instead
	of pending[] to avoid a traceback when refreshing a mounted channel.

2002-11-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (TransactCmd.resolve_deps): If we get back a
	"package not found" fault, handle it.

2002-11-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcchannelcmds.py (RefreshChannelCmd): Added "ref" as an alias.

	* rcmountcmds.py (MountCmd): Call os.path.abspath() instead of
	os.path.normpath() so relative paths work.  Get the return code to
	see if it was successful.

2002-11-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rclockcmds.py (LockAddCmd.execute): Show the command usage if no
	arguments are specified.
	
2002-11-05  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (find_package*): Clean these up a lot and make
	them all return lists of packages (except for
	find_package_on_system_exactly()). 
	(PackageListUpdatesCmd, SummaryCmd, PackageInstallCmd,
	PackageUpdateCmd): Remove "support" for	.rcexclude, since those
	are handled much better using rcd locks.
	(PackageInfoCmd, PackageInfo*Cmd, PackageInstallCmd,
	PackageRemoveCmd): Handle globbing.

2002-11-04  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcsystemcmds.py (ShutdownCmd.execute): Ping the server in a loop
	so we can tell when the daemon has been successfully shut down.

2002-11-01  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcsystemcmds.py (RecurringCmd): Added.  This is a command that
	lists any pending recurring actions.

2002-10-31  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcchannelutils.py (get_channels_by_name): Call string.lower() on
	the channel alias so we can match against aliases that aren't all
	lowercase.

2002-10-24  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py (main): A hack -- if running the 'dump' command,
	turn on terse mode to avoid any stray whitespace.

2002-10-22  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rclockcmds.py (LockAddCmd.arguments): Updated.
	(LockAddCmd.local_opt_table): Removed --name option.
	(LockAddCmd.execute): Added code to try to parse a glob or
	versioned dependency out of the non-option args.

	* rcformat.py (evr_to_str): Handle packages where the version is
	specified by a "version_str" field instead of a broken-out EVR.
	(evr_to_abbrev_str): Check to make sure that the release key
	exists.

2002-10-21  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcchannelutils.py: import rcfault and ximian_xmlrpclib to avoid
	a NameError in refresh_channels

2002-10-18  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am (rcsupport_DATA): moved rclockcmds.py to follow the
	ordering

2002-10-18  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am (rcsupport_DATA): Added rclockcmds.py.

2002-10-17  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageSearchCmd): Added the ability to filter
	searchs to include only locked or unlocked packages.

	* rclockcmds.py: Added.  Implements commands to list, add
	and remove locks.  ('add' is still sort of weak.)

	* rcmain.py: import rclockcmds

	* rcformat.py (importance_str_to_num): Added.
	(importance_num_to_str): Added.
	(importance_str_summary): Added.

2002-10-15  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (exclude_list): don't break the loop when we
	find a line with # as the first character

2002-10-15  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcusercmds.py: Added the long-lost user-edit command.

	* Makefile.am (rcsupport_DATA): Added rcmountcmds.py.

2002-10-15  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcchannelutils.py (refresh_channels): Added.  Moved the bulk of
	the work refreshing channels here.

	* rcchannelcmds.py (RefreshChannelCmd.execute): Mostly just a
	wrapper around above.

	* rcfault.py: Added undefined_method fault (mapping to an xmlrpc-c
	fault)

	* rcsystemcmds.py (ActivateCmd): Added.  Activates the system
	against a server and refreshes the channels on success.

2002-10-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcprefscmds.py (PrefsListCmd): add a -d option to not show the
	descriptions.

2002-10-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcfault.py: Added undefined_method fault.

	* rcmountcmds.py: Catch an undefined_method fault when trying to
	mount or unmount and tell the user that the daemon doesn't support
	it.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (find_remote_package): Added.  Uses urllib to
	parse and download URLs for packages.
	(find_package: Call find_remote_package() if find_local_package()
	fails.
	(TransactCmd.resolve_deps): Take a rollback argument, which calls
	rcd.packsys.rollback_dependencies().
	(TransactCmd.transact): Take a rollback argument.
	(PackageRollbackCmd): Added.  Rolls back packages to their
	previous state.

2002-10-10  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py: Import rcmountcmds.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (verbose_updates_list): When printing the
	update description, don't repeat the same message multiple times.
	(i.e. just print "New Snapshot Build" once instead of repeating it
	20 times.)

	* rcmountcmds.py: Add 'mount' and 'unmount' commands.

	* rcformat.py (package_to_row): If the package is locked, append a
	"L" to the status.

2002-10-01  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py (main): Use /var/run/rcd/rcd now.

2002-09-30  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (transact_and_poll): Exit if the
	download or transaction failed, or if the user aborted a download.

2002-09-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageListUpdatesCmd.execute): Print a
	warning if the user isn't subscribed to any channels.

2002-09-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageSearchCmd.execute): Make sure we have a
	guessed channel before we add it to the in_channel dictionary.
	Fixes searching for packages which were installed but didn't match
	any channels.

2002-09-18  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py (main): Cal expand_synthetic_args first.  This means
	that there is much more latitude in what can be done with
	--read-from-stdin and --read-from-file.  We now call
	get_user_default_args at the point that we previously called
	expand_synthetic_args.

	* rccommand.py (get_user_default_args): Broken out from
	expand_synthetic_args.  This is the code that handles the .rcrc
	files and RC_ARGS environment variable.
	(expand_synthetic_args): This code now just handles
	--read-from-file and --read-from-stdin.  Both of these options now
	have much saner sematics.  (This all fixes bugs #30496 and
	#30497.)

2002-09-18  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcusercmds.py: Show success/failure on adding or deleting users,
	change the text when adding a user.

2002-09-16  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcformat.py (transaction_status): Distinguish between an
	unverified signature and a non-existent signature.

2002-09-16  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (TransactCmd.resolve_deps): Just call
	sys.exit(0) instead of returning no values in the case of a
	successful verify.

2002-09-16  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcprefscmds.py (PrefsListCmd.execute): Don't try to show the
	description field if we're just getting one pref.

2002-09-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcprefscmds.py (PrefsListCmd.execute): Add the description field.

2002-09-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcformat.py (transaction_status): Add a "verify-nosig" entry
	into the table.

2002-09-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py: Add DRY_RUN and DOWNLOAD_ONLY
	(transact_and_poll): Take in a flags argument, pass that into
	rcd.packsys.transact() instead of the dry_run argument.  Add some
	logic for download only transactions.
	(TransactCmd.transact): Split out the dependency resolution out
	into the resolve_deps method.  Skip it if we're in download only
	mode.  Set the flags and pass them into transact_and_poll().
	(PackageInstallCmd, PackageUpdateCmd): Add a -d/--download-only
	option to the local_opt_table.

2002-09-13  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (pkg_to_key): Include the channel or channel
	guess in the key string that we construct.
	(PackageSearchCmd.execute): When walking across our list of
	packages to build up the in_channel dictionary, look at all
	installed packages -- not just those that have an explicit channel.
	This, along with the previous change, allows us to filter out
	a duplicate search result if we have multiple packages with the
	same name installed. (Bug #30194)
	
2002-09-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (TransactCmd.transact): Filter out duplicates
	before we resolve dependencies in case we have two different
	versions of one package installed and try to do an upgrade on it.

2002-09-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackagesCmd.execute): Do a "name-installed"
	query when -i is used, so we see what packages by that name are
	installed, but from another channel.

2002-09-11  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackagesCmd.execute): When handling a -i or -u
	option, query on "package-installed" instead of "name-installed".
	(PackageSearchCmd.execute): Ditto.  Also removed some work-around
	code that was necessary for name-installed but is no longer
	needed.

	* rcformat.py (package_to_row): Print a "v" in the status field
	if a package is name-installed but not installed.

2002-09-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcformat.py (pending_to_str): take an optional "time" argument
	which determines whether to display the elapsed and estimated
	times.
	(transaction_status): Get rid of the download, finish, and failed
	messages.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (transact_and_poll): Use the much saner method
	for tracking transaction progress in the daemon.  Get the three
	pending IDs and report status to the user.

2002-09-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageSearchCmd): Always do a name-installed
	search when the --installed-only flag is set.  After we do our
	search, if we were searching across all channels, filter out ones
	that don't have the installed bit set.

2002-09-05  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* ximian_xmlrpclib.py: Implement challenge/response
	authentication, make HTTP Basic auth use it, and implement HTTP
	Digest auth.

2002-08-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageInstallCmd): If "!" or "~" is prepended
	to a package name, then add that package as a package to be removed.

2002-08-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py: Check for socket.sslerror in the except clauses in a
	much more sane and functionally correct manner.

2002-08-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (TransactCmd.transact): Make 'N' the default
	for transactions... it safer this way.

2002-08-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rclogcmds.py (log_entries_list): Add whitespace between package
	name and EVR.

2002-08-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py: Debian doesn't ship with SSL support in their socket
	implementation by default, so we have to do some nasty nested try,
	except, and raise statements to see if we can even catch
	socket.sslerror exceptions.

2002-08-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcfault.py: Add no_icon fault.

2002-08-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py (main): Blah.  Catching the KeyboardInterrupt here
	wasn't enough.

	* rc.in: Put -everything- in a try block with a KeyboardInterrupt
	except.

2002-08-22  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py (main): Change the socket path from /tmp/rcd to
	/var/run/rcd to conform to the FHS.

2002-08-22  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py (main): As long as we are not in terse-mode, print
	some whitespace before and after we execute the command.  Catch
	the IOError exception and exit quietly so that we don't spew out a
	backtrace on broken pipes.

	* rccommand.py (RCCommand.process_argv): If getopt fails,
	try to print out a helpful message about which options were
	not recognized.

2002-08-22  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcsystemcmds.py (PingCmd): Get server URL and whether it's an
	enhanced/premium server from the ping response.

2002-08-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageSearchCmd): Remove the
	--show-package-ids options.  Fix a typo that prevented
	--search-descriptions from working and add a -d alias.  Always use
	"name-installed" when using --uninstalled-only and use it when
	searching just inside one channel.

2002-08-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py: Make rc_version a global, and set it when main() gets
	called.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (transact_and_poll): Send rcmain.rc_name and
	rcmain.rc_version as the fourth and fifth arguments to
	rcd.packsys.transact().

2002-08-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageUpdateCmd): We need to inherit
	TransactCmd's local_opt_table.

2002-08-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageListUpdatesCmd, SummaryCmd): Don't
	include excluded updates in these commands, but let the user know

	(exclude_list): Move this out of the TransactCmd class.

2002-08-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcfault.py: Add cant_refresh fault.

	* rcmain.py (main): Handle KeyboardInterrupt quietly.

2002-08-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py: Added is_basic to update, install, remove, and
	info commands.

2002-08-20  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcformat.py (pending_to_str): Some tweaks to shrink the download
	status line.  Fixes (or at least helps) bug #29169.

2002-08-19  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py (main): Force the connection to be local when using
	the "help" command.  This keeps you from being prompted for a
	password if you run "rc -h foo help".

2002-08-16  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageSolveCmd.execute): If we haven't
	specified a version or release in a dep, set them to "*".  Since
	our relation is "(any)", they are ignored and we can put whatever
	we want there... but since the dep can now be displayed in an
	error message, this looks a lot better than having them set to
	"foo" and "bar" like before. :)

2002-08-15  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rctalk.py (stdout_is_file): Added a check to see if stdout has
	been redirected to a file.
	(message_status): If stdout has been redirected, don't print any
	escape codes with the message.
	(message_finished): Ditto.

	* rccommand.py (RCCommand.usage): Rearranged output so that the
	command-specific options appear before the general options.  Added
	a line of whitespace before the first "usage:" line.
	(usage_basic): Added whitespace after last line of text.
	(usage_full): Added whitespace after last line of text.

2002-08-12  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcprefscmds.py (PrefsSetCmd.execute): If we were unable to set
	the preference, don't print the "Preference 'foo' changed from
	'bar' to 'baz'" message.

2002-08-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackagesCmd): If --uninstalled-only is passed
	in without a channel, show all of the uninstalled packages across
	all channels.

2002-08-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackagesCmd): Change --not-installed to
	--uninstalled-only for consistency.

	requested.

2002-08-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcformat.py (transaction_status): No sense in doing a split and
	then putting a lot of them back together.  Just split the first
	colon.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackagesCmd): Added --installed-only and
	--not-installed flags.
	(PackageUpdatecmd): Try to open ~/.rcexclude, which contains a
	list of package names to not upgrade.

2002-08-09  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py: Changed PackageUpdatesCmd to
	PackageListUpdatesCmd, changed the name to "list-updates" and
	added "lu" alias.  Changed PackageUpdateAllCmd to
	PackageUpdateCmd, changed name to "update" and added "up" alias.
	Added two-letter aliases for most other commands.

	* rclogcmds.py, rcusercmds.py: Added two-letter aliases for some
	commands.

2002-08-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (TransactCmd.transact): Take a third return
	value from the dependency functions to match the change in rcd.

2002-08-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcchannelcmds.py (RefreshChannelCmd.execute): Fix the percent
	calculation.

2002-08-07  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rccommand.py (join_args): Strip the elements of the list after
	combining, so that our two args are both treated the same.
	(expand_synthetic_args): Reverse the argument join-order for
	--read-from-file and --read-from-stdin.

	* rcchannelutils.py (validate_channel_list): Don't print our
	"'abbrev' matches 'channelname'" message in terse mode.

2002-08-07  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageInstallCmd.execute,
	PackageRemoveCmd.execute, PackageSolveCmd.execute): Err, we don't
	need to do that pointless map().

2002-08-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageInstallCmd.execute): If we have a
	duplicate package name in the list, abort.
	(PackageRemoveCmd.execute, PackageSolveCmd.execute): If we have
	duplicate entries in the list, show a warning.

2002-08-06  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (transact_and_poll): Call
	rctalk.message_finished() if the transfer fails, so we have a
	newline to show the failure on.
	(PackageSolveCmd.execute): Keep a list of valid relations and
	abort if it isn't valid.

2002-08-05  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rc.in: Remove extraneous imports.

2002-08-05  Aaron Weber  <aaron@ximian.com>

	the current username for remote connections.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (transact_and_poll): Replace "Abort" with
	"Cancel".

	* rcprefscmds.py (PrefsSetCmd.execute): Tell the user what pref is
	being changed, what it was, and what it is now.

2002-08-01  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	line.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageSolveCmd.execute): Another patch from

	for 'what-provides'.
	(WhatRequiresCmd.aliases): Added 'wr' as an alias for
	'what-requires'.
	(WhatConflictsCmd.aliases): Added 'wc' as an alias for
	'what-conflicts'.

	* rcchannelcmds.py (UnsubscribeCmd.execute): Removed dry-run
	logic... it just seems like overkill to have that option for basic
	channel operations that are inherently totally safe.
	(SubscribeCmd.execute): Ditto. 
	(RefreshChannelCmd.execute): Ditto.

	* rcmain.py (main): Set rctalk.show_debug only if the RC_DEBUG
	environment variable is set.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageDebugCmd.execute): Send the "Getting a
	dump of the system..." and "Dump finished." messages directly to
	stderr instead using our rctalk commands.  This allows you to just
	do a 'rc debug > foo' and not have crap at the beginning and end
	of the XML file.
	
2002-07-28  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (find_package_in_channel): Print an "Unable to
	find package" warning if a specific channel was specified.
	(PackageInfoConflictsCmd.execute): Exit if the requested package
	was not found.  Suppress self-conflicts.

	* rcmain.py: Handle socket.sslerror as well.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (transact_and_poll): Err, but we also don't
	want to be very stupid about it; make sure we only show it once.

2002-07-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (transact_and_poll): Print a newline after the
	download is done, and print "Download complete" there instead of
	trying to be clever and failing.

2002-07-25  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageInfoConflictsCmd.execute): Do the
	right thing if there are no conflicts.

	confirmation before transacting (unless we are in no-confirmation
	mode, of course).

2002-07-24  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	aliases.

	the command_dict along with the rest of the information.
	(print_command_list): Added.  Breaks out the code (previously in
	usage()) for formatting and printing a list of commands.
	(usage_basic): Replaces usage().  Prints out a list of our basic
	commands.
	(usage_full): Also replaces usage().  Prints out a list of all
	commands and all global options.
	(extract_command_from_argv): If there is no command on the command
	line, call usage_basic()... unless "--help" is also on the command
	line, in which case we call usage_full().
	(RCCommand.category): Added.  Our default category is "unknown".

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackagesCmd.category): Added.  Category is
	"basic".

	the pending action IDs of our channel downloads, and block & poll
	the actions while the downloads occur.

	* rcusercmds.py (UserAddCmd.is_hidden): Should be os.getuid() !=
	0, not os.getuid != 0.
	(UserDeleteCmd): Added.  A command that deletes users from

	* rcpackagecmds.py (find_local_package): Check to see if we're
	local and stream the package down if we're not.

	(main): If the user doesn't specify a password in non-local mode,
	we prompt for one.

	* rcutil.py: Added.  Currently contains just the hexstr function
	(moved from rcmain.py) and an md5ify_password convenience

	the other transaction-based commands (install, remove, update-all,

	rcd.packsys.resolve_dependencies().

2002-07-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py: Oops, I need to call extract_packages() on all
	the dep_install and dep_remove lists so transactions work.

2002-07-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (format_dependencies): Reworked to include info
	on what channel a package is coming from, and why dependencies are
	being pulled in.
	(PackageDebugCmd.execute): Open a file for write instead of
	append; we probably just want to truncate it.

2002-07-11  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rctalk.py (fatal): Added (via Jose).  A convenience function
	that prints an error message and then fails.

2002-07-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageInstallCmd.execute,
	PackageRemoveCmd.execute, PackageUpdateAllCmd.execute,
	PackageVerifyCmd.execute): Catch dependency failure faults on
	resolve_dpeendencies() and verify_dependencies(), show them to the
	user, and exit out.

2002-07-08  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rccommand.py (usage): Stupidly, the max function fails if you
	pass it a single argument; this means that apply(max, foo)
	generates an error if len(foo) is 1.  While that case would
	probably never come up in this bit of code, it seems imprudent not
	to work around it.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageInfoCmd.execute): Also changed to work
	around the max-needs-two-args bug... but in this case it can
	actually happen, so the fix is more than just pedantry.

2002-07-07  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py (main): Catch ximian_xmlrpclib.ProtocolError, not
	cgiwrap.ProtocolError anymore.

	an arg, since we can now get the description directly from the
	object.  Register aliases in a separate dictionary.
	(construct): I've disabled matching unambiguous substrings based
	on a conversation with Karl Fogel.  Now we only match against the
	full command name or against a pre-defined set of aliases.
	(usage): Include aliases in our usage output.
	(RCCommand.aliases): Added.  A method for getting a list of
	aliases for the command.
	(RCCommand.arguments): Added.  A method returning a description of
	our non-option args which we display as part of our usage

	into a list of columns.

	* rcchannelcmds.py: Cut all of our channel utility commands

	Python 2.2.  Forward-ported my HTTP Basic auth and unix domain
	socket patches.

2002-07-02  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	slightly.
	(PackageVerifyCmd): Added, allows the user to verify the
	dependency tree and install/remove packages to correct any
	inconsistencies.

2002-07-02  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py: Removed some debug spew that somehow got left in.

	* rcformat.py: Replaced some "print"s with rctalk.foo calls.

	(bytes_to_str): Added.
	(pending_to_str): Use seconds_to_str and bytes_to_str for nicer
	output.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageSearchCmd.execute): If
	--search-descriptions is set, use the "text" key for the search.

2002-07-01  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackageUpdateAllCmd) Renamed, used to be
	"PackageUpdateCmd".  That was just too close to
	"PackageUpdatesCmd" for me.
	(PackageSearchCmd): Killed off the old search command.  The
	experimental "frobnicate" searcher is now just "search".
	(append_to_table): Use the "channel_guess" when it is available.

	when we match against both the in-channel and installed records
	for the same package.

	look nicer.

	printing them.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (transact_and_poll): Things feel "snappier"
	if we poll more frequently during the download.

	query-related options and added three different ways of formatting
	output corresponding to "normal", --verbose and --terse mode.
	
2002-07-01  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py: Make local a file-global variable, so we can see if
	we're connecting locally or over HTTP.

	option, "allow_unsub" to allow searching for a matching package in
	unsubscribed channels.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackagesCmd.execute): If the --match-word
	option is set, use the 'contains_word' operator in our query
	instead of 'contains'.

2002-06-26  Jon Trowbridge  <trow@ximian.com>

	* rcmain.py: Call expanduser so that we can actually find
	the .rcrc file.
	
	* rcmain.py: Support a .rcrc file.  Fixed bugs related to handling
	of RC_ARGS, --read-from-file, etc.  Walk through our list of

	(RCCommand.default_orthogonal_opts): Added.
	(RCCommand.local_orthogonal_opts): Added.

	intelligible error message if we have a syntax error or something
	in one of our modules.

	* rcpackagecmds.py (PackagesCmd): Added.  An implementation of my

	* rcmain.py (main): If we don't get the HTTP error code or XML-RPC

	and advance the line as usual.

	--read-from-stdin.

	* rcchannelcmds.py: Change a print to an rctalk.message

2002-06-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* rcpackagecmds.py (install_indicator): Get the system packages
	from the daemon so we can show if each package is installed on the
