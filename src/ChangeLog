	* rc: Handle cases like "rc -U channels refresh 20001" in which
	"channels" could get picked up as the action instead of "refresh".

	* rcchannelcmds.py: Pulled the default_opt_table out of the
	RCCommand class so we could walk it, for the above.

	* rcchannelcmds.py (RefreshChannelCmd): Added, refreshes all of

	* rcformat.py (opt_table): Added.  Generates a formated description
	of a list of command options.  Added license.

	* rccommand.py: Changed command registration slightly.  Hacked

	default options into an RCCommand method.  Added license.

	* rcchannelcmds.py: Added support for more options, improved
