CONTRIBUTING
------------
Contributors to rc are more than welcome.  rcd is written in Python
(compatible with 1.5.2 and newer).

Discussion takes place on the rc-devel@lists.ximian.com mailing list.
Patches should be sent there, and should follow the existing stylistic
conventions, be accompanied by a ChangeLog entry, and sent in GNU
unified diff format (diff -u).

Please DO NOT commit to CVS without approval from one of the maintainers.
