rc is a command-line interface to the Red Carpet Daemon (rcd), and
complement to Ximian Red Carpet.

ABOUT RC
--------
To use rc, you will also need the Red Carpet Daemon (rcd), available
in the "rcd" module in GNOME CVS (and probably from wherever you got
this package).

rc uses XML-RPC, either over unix domain sockets (for local connections)
or secure HTTP (for remote connections).  Yes, rc can be used to manage
systems remotely.  That's part of the reason why it's so cool.

Security is handled by the Red Carpet Daemon.  Remote connections
will require a username and password, whereas local connections are
authorized by the kernel.  By default all local users have only viewing
privileges (except root, which has superuser privileges); remote users
have no privileges.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
A man page is included with the package, and should provide pretty
complete information on how to use rc.  In addition, there is usage
help by running "rc" and more detailed info by running "rc --help".

BUILDING AND DEVELOPING
-----------------------
rc is written in Python, so there isn't any building involved.
However, it does use the GNU autotools and make to make distribution
and installation easier.  You will need to run configure (or autogen.sh
if from CVS) before you can run rc.

We welcome contributors to rc and rcd.  Please see the HACKING file for
more info on contributing.
