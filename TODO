Implement "verify".

Fix formatting for package searching, updates, etc.

Activation/registration.

Implements "preferences" command.

Need docs and a man page.

Port our local changes to xmlrpclib (currently in ximian_xmlrpclib) to
the python 2.2 xmlrpclib.  ximian_xmlrpclib is currently based on the
1.5.2 xmlrpclib, and is incompatible with 2.x.  However, the python
2.2 xmlrpclib is backwards-compatible and will work under 1.5.2 --- or
at least it claims to be able to.
