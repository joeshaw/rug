Activation/registration.

Need docs and a man page.

We need to review all of the user-visible strings for grammar and
intelligibility.  And we need to add long descriptions for the
commands.  Aaron would probably be a good person to do this with,
since he knows about words and stuff.

Do we do anything in the way of checks to make sure that there is
enough disk space to download the packages?  If not, we need to add
this!  (libredcarpet should be doing this stuff!)

Need to format update output to be less "apt-like", to show what channel
packages are coming in from, to show versions in --verbose mode, etc.


--------------

Talk to Carlos about moving to a public CVS.  And talk to him about
needing Aaron for docs.

Talk to Frank about packaging and snapshots.
