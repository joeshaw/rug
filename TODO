Activation/registration.

Need docs and a man page.

We need to review all of the user-visible strings for grammar and
intelligibility.  And we need to add long descriptions for the
commands.  Aaron would probably be a good person to do this with,
since he knows about words and stuff.

Do we do anything in the way of checks to make sure that there is
enough disk space to download the packages?  If not, we need to add
this!  (libredcarpet should be doing this stuff!)

Need to check through all the source files and check to make sure
the license is GPL v2 only.  (not "at your option, any later version")
