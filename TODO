Activation/registration.

Need docs and a man page.

We need to review all of the user-visible strings for grammar and
intelligibility.  And we need to add long descriptions for the
commands.  Aaron would probably be a good person to do this with,
since he knows about words and stuff.

Add a 'debug' command that gets and spits out an XMLified version of
the RCWorld.  (This will replace cur_to_xml.)
